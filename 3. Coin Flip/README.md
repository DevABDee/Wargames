### CHallenge:
- This is a coin flipping game where you need to build up your winning streak by guessing the outcome of a coin flip. To complete this level you'll need to use your psychic abilities to guess the correct outcome 10 times in a row.

### Solution:
- The source of randomness is wrong and very predictable. Created Contract Attack.sol to complete this level.

PS: This level tested my patience so much xD

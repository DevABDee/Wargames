### Challenge:
To solve this level, you only need to provide the Ethernaut with a Solver, a contract that responds to whatIsTheMeaningOfLife() with the right number.
- The solver's code needs to be really tiny: 10 opcodes at most.

### Solution:
- This challenge was pretty difficult, but I was able to solve it with the help of a D-Squared video and several articles on this subject by 0xSage and others.

### Takeaways:
- I learned a lot about stack machines, the EVM, how it works, how bytecode is created and learned different EVM OpCodes.
- I am looking forward to learning more about EVM bytecodes in detail in the future IA.
